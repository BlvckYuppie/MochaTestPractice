**MochaTestPractice**
===================


*A TDD / mongo method practice session.*
----------------------------------------




I've always been **REALLY** bad at writing tests, I don't practice TDD in my projects as much as I **KNOW** I  should, and i've never been particularly **CONFIDENT** in my knowledge of mongoose methods.

To kill as many proverbial birds with one stone as possible, I've decided to implement full Crud with relations / associations, written in Mongo, using only Mocha tests.

The idea being: the repetition should allow me to become more proficient at test writing, having to deep dive the mongoose docs should expose me to a lot of methods and patterns I wasn't aware of, and my front-end code, moving forward, will be easier to debug, because passing tests ensure that the problem isn't coming from the backend.  

The goal is to spend a week writing nothing but tests.  I will push my commit's up with each passing test.

Feel free to fork n' clone this repo.  Once the code is on your machine, ***cd***  to the directory in terminal and run

> **npm run test**

to execute the test suite.
