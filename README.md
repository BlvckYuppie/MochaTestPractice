**MochaTestPractice**
===================


*A TDD / mongo method practice session.*
----------------------------------------




I've always been **REALLY** bad a writing tests, I don't practice TDD in my projects as much as I should, and i've never been super confident in my knowledge of mongoose methods.

To kill as many proverbial birds with one stone as possible, I've decided to implement full Crud with relations / associations with Mongo using only Mocha tests.

The idea being, repetition should allow me to become more efficient at test writing, having to deep dive the mongoose docs should expose me to a lot of methods and patterns I wasn't aware of, and my front-end code, moving forward, will be easier to debug, because passing tests will ensure that the problem isn't coming from the backend.  

The goal is to spend a week writing nothing but tests.  I will push my commit's up with each passing test.

Feel free to fork n' clone this repo.  Once the code is on your machine, ***cd***  to the directory in terminal and run

> **npm run test**

to execute the test suite.
